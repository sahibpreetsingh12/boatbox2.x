webistes to be checked:-


# SARAB SIR LAST MEET
# to be done
sentence based parsing
and check each senetence is related to boats
1. break senetence
2. ner
3. check for sentence similarity
4. set a threshold


have to ask questions for making rich user interface at boatbox


1. dual encoder (for classification purposes)
2. can use transformer in place of LSTM.


# MY section



# now have to see about Lookups and synonyms and how to use retrieval intents

# have to inculcate threshold value concept in cosine similarity concept

# have to include wrong words as synoym for some words in Boat part entity(IMPORTANT ****)


# Fallback poilicy is not implemented 
# OUT of Scope Intent 
    1. Will create Lookup tables 




december 2

There will be some questions like :-
    1. My boat is not starting
    2. I am having issues with my boat
    3. When i turned the key on my boat nothing happens
so to handle these kind of open ended questions we will make Hard Coded Utter response

OUr pipeline willbe changed accordngly so fisrtly we will see if user input is matching with any hard code response
if not then we will turn the conversation to cosine similarity logic


point 2. :- So answers in faq.csv should not be correlated to each other in any sense
