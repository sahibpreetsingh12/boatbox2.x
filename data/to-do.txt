# to be done
sentence based parsing
and check each senetence is related to boats
1. break senetence
2. ner
3. check for sentence similarity
4. set a threshold


have to ask questions for making rich user interface at boatbox


1. dual encoder (for classification purposes)
2. can use transformer in place of LSTM.


#
Have to see if we CAN solve the problem of entity not found using retrieval intents

# Up error is sorted

# now have to see about Lookups and synonyms and how to use retrieval intents

# have to inculcate threshold value concept in cosine similarity concept
