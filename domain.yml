  utter_repair_core:
  - text: Core damage primarily happens due to the intrusion of water through hull-fittings
      or deck-fittings Repairing the damage to the core involves removing the fibreglass
      skin to expose the core, which is as good as making it anew. The basic solution
      to repairing the core is to open the affected area, remove any water and delaminated
      core, and insert a replacement core that re-establishes the structural integrity
      of the boat.
  utter_repair_hull:
  - text: There are two scenarios where a  {boat_part} can be damaged â€“ one is when
      the hull is damaged above the waterline, the second when it is damaged below
      the waterline.For first scenario take it out and dry it thoroughly.For hull
      repair, a basic fibreglass repair kit is used, using which the damaged section
      is removed in a circular cut. The part can be then patched using either fibreglass
      and the proper adhesives or the putties available.
